# Part2: Dive Deeper into GitHub Actions -- Work in Progress
GitHub Actions workflows are code so we need to consider versioning, troubleshooting and test the code. 

Let's take a hands-on approach and walk-through this together.
1. Create a GitHub account (https://github.com) (if you have not done so already.)

2. Create a samples repository for our testing.

## AutomatedÂ Assignment Evaluation
1. Contributor completes assignment file
2. Contributor submits a pull request for assignment file to the Modern Apps Ninja course repository
3. GitHub Action verify-assignment is triggered to run
3.1 If assignment results are correct the pull request is closed
3.2 If the assignment results are incorrect the error is posted to the pull request for modification.
