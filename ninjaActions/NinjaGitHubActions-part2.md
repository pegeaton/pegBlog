# Part2: Dive Deeper into GitHub Actions -- Work in Progress
GitHub Actions workflows are code so we need to consider versioning, troubleshooting and test the code. 



## Create a simple test program written in go
Let's take a hands-on approach and walk-through this together. GitHub documentation (https://docs.github.com/) is available as a reference.

1. Create a GitHub account (https://github.com) (if you have not done so already.)

2. Create a samples repository 

2. Create a README.md file (we will use this later) for the repository.

3. Create a file called hello.go within your samples repository containing the following code:

   	package main

		import (

			"fmt"

		)


		func main() {

			fmt.Println("Hello, world.")

		}

This code will be run by the workflow on a push operation.

## create a simple GitHub Action
1. Create a workflow directory within your repository called .github/workflows

1. Create a file called hello-action.yml within the workflows diretory (.github/workflows/hello-action.yml)

## AutomatedÂ Assignment Evaluation
1. Contributor completes assignment file
2. Contributor submits a pull request for assignment file to the Modern Apps Ninja course repository
3. GitHub Action verify-assignment is triggered to run
3.1 If assignment results are correct the pull request is closed
3.2 If the assignment results are incorrect the error is posted to the pull request for modification.
