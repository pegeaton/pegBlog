# Part2: Dive Deeper into GitHub Actions

Let's take a hands-on approach and walk-through creating the hello world program and GitHub Actions workflow together.  The GitHub documentation (https://docs.github.com/) is available as a reference as needed throughout the exercise.

In this excercise you will create a GitHub repository containing three files: README.md, hello.go, and hello-action.yml.  The file structure is shown in the following diagram:

## 1. Create a GitHub Account
Create a GitHub account, if you have not done so already.  

In our example, the account is **pegeaton**


## 2. Create a repository 
2.1 Create a **samples** repository within your GitHub account.  The repository is used to store your files.

## 2. Create a README.md within the repository 
Create a *README.md* file (we will use this later) in the repository containing the following:
		# Samples Repository
		This repository contains examples:
			* hello.go code example
			* hello-action.yml example
		
	

## 3. Create a simple test program written in go
Create a file called *hello.go* within your samples repository containing the following code:

   		package main
			import (
				"fmt"
			)

			func main() {
				fmt.Println("Hello, world.")
			}

This code will be run by the GitHub Action workflow on a push operation.

## 4. create directory to contain the GitHub Actions
Create a workflow directory within your repository called *.github/workflows*

## 5. create a simple GitHub Actions workflow
Create a file called *hello-action.yml* within the workflows diretory (.github/workflows/hello-action.yml)

## AutomatedÂ Assignment Evaluation
1. Contributor completes assignment file
2. Contributor submits a pull request for assignment file to the Modern Apps Ninja course repository
3. GitHub Action verify-assignment is triggered to run
3.1 If assignment results are correct the pull request is closed
3.2 If the assignment results are incorrect the error is posted to the pull request for modification.
